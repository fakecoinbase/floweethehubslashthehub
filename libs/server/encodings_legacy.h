/**
 * Why base-58 instead of standard base-64 encoding?
 * - Don't want 0OIl characters that look the same in some fonts and
 *      could be used to create visually identical looking data.
 * - A string with non-alphanumeric characters is not as easily accepted as input.
 * - E-mail usually won't line-break if there's no punctuation to break at.
 * - Double-clicking selects the whole string as one word if it's all alphanumeric.
